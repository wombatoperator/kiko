If Ram can replicate the 1500 recipe in the midsize segment, it has a good chance of eating into Tacoma sales.

The NHTSA says its 2029 regulations surrounding automatic emergency braking systems will help prevent hundreds of deaths and scores of injuries. Now, the Alliance of Automotive Innovation, made up of automakers like Ford and Toyota, is suing the Department of Transportation (DOT) over the new requirements.

From time to time, these canines need to go somewhere, whether it's a trip to the vet or a park for a walk. This situation raises the question about how folks travel with their pups.

Christopher Christopher 2 days ago Posts Would You Consider Buying A Three-Year-Old Lexus Hybrid? Luxury vehicles don't usually hold their value very well, and that can be a good or a bad thing depending on whether you're a buyer or a seller. There are plenty of options you can find in the used market, and one of them is vehicles from Lexus. Toyota's luxury arm is known to be a reliable brand, and in fact, was recently awarded the most reliable brand for used cars. And, there's no doubt they come with efficient hybrid engines and plenty of creature comforts inside the cabin. So, keeping all that in mind, would you consider picking up a three-year-old Lexus hybrid model? Or, would you instead go for something new without a luxury badge at the same price you'd get a used Lexus? https://www.topspeed.com/3-year-old-lexus-hybrid-buy-used/ Siddhant Siddhant 5 days ago Posts Electric Cars More Here's The Resale Value Of A Used Tesla Model Y After 3 Years Posts By Nikesh Kooverjee 4 hours ago 10 Hybrids Worth Considering If You Maintain A One-Car Garage Posts By Joe Duarte 5 hours ago Here's Why Buying This Plug-in Hybrid In 2025 Is A Smart Decision Posts By Andrew Koopman 6 hours ago The Hybrid Car That Feels Like A Lexus Without The Price Tag Posts By Ben Shimkus 7 hours ago Used Electric Vehicles Lose More Value Than Any Other Segment Posts By Ty Duffy 9 hours ago Latest All Fast Cars Mass Market EVs Motorcycles The Full-Size Luxury Sedan That’s Now Cheaper Than A New Camry Lexus LS Is this an amazing deal or is the new Camry just too expensive?

They snuck in furniture, tapped into the mall's electricity, and even secretly constructed a brick wall with a locking door, smuggling in over 2 tons of cinderblock. Far more than just a wild prank, the secret apartment became a deeply meaningful place for all its inhabitants - a personal expression of defiance against local gentrification, a boundary-pushing work of public/private art, a clubhouse to coordinate their artistic charity, and finally, a 750 square foot space that sticks it to the man. 76 Metascore 2024 Documentary Watchlist Where to Watch Kids 1 hr 31 mins Summer, New York City, 1995.

Buying laptop in US for UK gift Move Right Six Things to Know About Apple's Upcoming Foldable iPhone Friday March 28, 2025 3:54 pm PDT by Juli Clover We've been hearing rumors about a foldable iPhone for almost a decade now, but it looks like we might finally see the device come to fruition in 2026. We're going to be waiting many more months for the foldable ‌iPhone‌, but so far we're hearing good things. Apple wants to make it creaseless . It's taken Apple multiple years to design a foldable ‌iPhone‌ that it's satisfied with because Apple wants to get away from the pesky crease that impacts most foldable smartphones on the market. Apple is aiming for an entirely creaseless look so you won't be distracted by a visible line going through the middle of the display. It'll open like a book . Based on the myriad rumors we've heard, Apple experimented with multiple designs. There was talk last year that Apple would go with a clamshell design that opens top to bottom, like the Galaxy Z Flip. That's possibly something we'll see in the future, but now it's sounding like Apple's first foldable ‌iPhone‌ will have the book-like design we've seen in foldables like the Galaxy Z Fold. iOS isn't designed for a horizontal orientation, so this is going to require some major software updates. Apple is rumored to be working to redesign iOS 19 , iPadOS 19, and macOS 16 to be more consistent cross-platform, and that kind of design would work well when you need an operating system that works seamlessly in both vertical and horizontal orientations. For size, imagine the iPad mini . When it's closed, Apple's foldable ‌iPhone‌ is rumored to have a 5.5-inch outer display, which is smaller than current ‌iPhone‌ models that start at 6.1 inches. When opened, though, it will be 7.8 inches, which isn't too far off from the old 7.9-inch iPad mini . Picture the ‌iPad mini‌ in horizontal orientation, or put two 6.1-inch iPhones side by side to get an idea of how big the display might be. It's going to be thick and thin . Apple is going to use some iPhone 17 Air tech for the foldable ‌iPhone‌, and it could be as thin as 4.8mm when it's opened up. That's even thinner than the 5.1-inch 12.9-inch iPad Pro , which is Apple's thinnest device to date. When closed, though, it'll be somewhere around 9mm to 9.5mm, which is chunky. It might have Touch ID. This is a weird one, but Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo says Apple might use a Touch ID power button instead of Face ID . If Apple can't slim down that front-facing TrueDepth camera module enough to get the screen to an acceptable thinness, ‌Touch ID‌ could work instead. It's going to cost you . Foldable smartphones are far from cheap, even from Android manufacturers. Apple's version is going to be expensive, with rumors suggesting it will be priced somewhere around $2,000 to $2,500. These are just the current rumors, and in the years before a device actually launches, information can be all over the place due to Apple's experimentation. The details we're hearing are starting to firm up, but there could be changes before it comes out. And given Apple's track record lately, it might never be released. Right now, it looks like we could get the first foldable ‌iPhone‌ right around late 2026, so we might be hearing more in the coming months as we get into the 2026 ‌iPhone‌ rumor cycle.

Printing isn't as common as it used to be, though it's still good to have a printer on hand (saving on trips to the library or a friend's house). You might only print a few times a year for government forms or similar, or maybe you print every day for your job. How often do you print?

Ben_Stegner Ben_Stegner 11 hours ago Posts How Long Does Your Phone Last Before Needing a Charge? Battery life is one of the primary concerns for any smartphone; nobody wants to worry about the battery dying all day.

I never let my phone run low, so it's hard to give an exact estimate. I charge it at least a little bit every day -- usually from 50% back up to 80%. It could probably last a whole day if I needed it to. Ben_Stegner Ben_Stegner 1 day ago Posts 5 Do You Ever Watch Movies on Your Phone?

But there's definitely something lost when you watch a film shot for the big screen on a device that fits in your pocket. Do you watch movies on your phone? Why or why not? I don't for various reasons; I wouldn't find it comfortable to look at my phone for that long, and you don't get the full experience on such a small display.

stylemotivation.com,"Style Motivation - Blog for style motivation Home Fashion Home Decor Art & Architecture Travel Cars DIY & Crafts LifeStyle Style Motivation Style Motivation When you’re working on a building or renovation, you want the right materials for the job. While there are countless options out there, aluminium window frames are a versatile and attractive choice. In the modern age of eco-friendly construction, an aluminium joinery in your design can lead to a more environmentally friendly, energy-efficient building. Why Aluminium Window Frames? When it comes to building, aluminium window frames are an excellent go-to. Aluminium window frames understand that less is more; they’re lightweight, yet durable so they can be used in both residential and commercial properties. Plus, they have a sleek appearance that bolsters Moving to a new home or office is an exciting yet stressful process. One of the biggest decisions you’ll face is whether to hire professional movers or handle the move yourself. While DIY moving may seem like a cost-effective solution, it often comes with hidden challenges and expenses. If you’re moving within New Jersey, hiring small movers can be a game-changer. Here’s why professional small movers in NJ are a better choice than taking the DIY route. 1. Convenience and Time Savings Packing, loading, transporting, and unloading your belongings can take days, even weeks, if you handle it alone. Spring dress trends always seem to hit the same tired notes—florals, pastels, light fabrics. But let’s be honest, that gets old fast. What if spring dressing wasn’t about dusting off the same pieces you’ve had for years or chasing trends that don’t feel like you? This season isn’t about the cliché; it’s about dresses that feel fresh, wearable, and just a little unexpected. Think effortless silhouettes with attitude, pieces you’ll wear beyond spring, and fabrics that make sense whether you’re brunching, working, or just existing. The Rise of the “Anti-Bodycon” Silhouette Body-hugging dresses have had their time, but spring’s real Gold has always been in the background—classic, timeless, reliable. But lately, it’s stepped out of the supporting role and into the spotlight, commanding attention in ways that feel fresh, bold, and anything but predictable. It’s no longer just the metal you reach for when you want something “neutral” or “versatile.” Now, gold is the outfit-maker, the mood-setter, the statement you didn’t know you needed. So, what’s driving gold’s resurgence? It’s not about tradition anymore. It’s about reimagining what gold can be—chunky, sculptural, playful, rebellious. The question isn’t, “Should I wear gold?” It’s more like, “Is gold the new black?” Chunky Renovating your home is an exciting, albeit tumultuous task. If you’re planning on giving your living room a facelift, upgrading your kitchen to a sleeker model, or simply improving your home, you will find that moving furniture can be a hassle.
